title: Apps & files in Windows

## Managing storage space

You should plan how you want to organize your files on your computer. Depending on your needs & storage capacity, you may want to use different strategies.

Usually, I recommend to configure at least two partitions on your hard drives:
- One for the operating system (Windows) & your apps
- One for your personal files

This way, if case you might need to, you can easily reinstall Windows without losing any of your personal files.

You may want to use a third partition dedicated to your apps or games, especially if you have a large storage capacity.

### Storage capacity scenarios

Low storage capacity (256 GB or less):
- One single partition for everything: Windows, apps, personal files.
- Make sure to backup your personal files regularly.

Medium storage capacity (256 GB to 1 TB):
- First partition for Windows & apps: between ¼ and ½ of your storage capacity.
- Second partition for personal files: the rest of your storage capacity.

High storage capacity (2 TB or more):
- First partition for Windows: 256 GB should be comfortable.
- Second partition for apps: between 256 GB and 1 TB.
- Third partition for personal files: the rest of your storage capacity.
- If you wish, you can create a fourth partition for games to keep them separated from your apps.
- If you have multiple hard drives, you may split one for the first two partitions and use another entirely for personal files.


## Installing apps

I personnally do **not** recommend using the Windows Store to install apps. Make sure to download your installers from the official website of the software you want to install, and not from a third-party download platform.

If you have a dedicated partition for your apps and if given the choice, I recommend:
- Installing startups apps on the Windows partition.
- Installing all other apps on the dedicated partition.


## File organization

This is highly opinionated, but where is how I organize my files.

On a dedicated partition to apps and/or personal files:

- `D:\Progs\` for apps
- `D:\Games\` for games
- `D:\Downloads\` for downloads (e.g. installers from the web browser)
- `D:\Files\` for personal files
- `D:\WSL\` for WSL distros (if you use WSL)
