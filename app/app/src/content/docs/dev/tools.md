## Run your apps

Run everything with Docker!
- Ensure your app runs the same on all machines.
- Clone your codebase anywhere and pick up your dev environment as you made it.

Debugging might be harder to configure as your local machine is isolated from the container, but it saves you a lot of time in the long run.


## CLI tools

I've made some CLI tools to speed up your workflow:

- [DockerC](https://github.com/matiboux/dockerc/): Wrapper for docker compose commands.  
  It makes it easier to run docker commands in the context of a project. It also provides shorthands to common commands.

I also use these tools:

- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/): Command-line JSON processor.  
  It is a must-have for any developer working with JSON data, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.


## IDE tools

I've made some CLI tools to speed up your workflow:

- [Instant Commit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Matiboux.instant-commit) (VS Code): Auto-generate messages based on changes for one-click commits.  
  It saves you time while keeping commits clean and consistent. It only describes changes made to the file tree, so it is suitable for commits in documentation, configuration, or anywhere where a detailed description is not necessary.


## Devlopment tools

I've made some development tools to help your development process:

- [CORS Proxy](https://cors-proxy.matiboux.com): Simple CORS proxy server to bypass browser restrictions locally.


## Online tools

I've made some online tools to help you in everyday dev tasks and speed up your workflow. Check them out!

- [Env Converter](https://envconverter.matiboux.com): Convert your `.env` files between different formats.
- [EML Reader](https://emlreader.matiboux.com): Read `.eml` files without opening an email client.
