## Run your apps

Run everything with Docker!
- Ensure your app runs the same on all machines.
- Clone your codebase anywhere and pick up your dev environment as you made it.

Debugging might be harder to configure as your local machine is isolated from the container, but it saves you a lot of time in the long run.
